### Mesh adaptation in Firedrake

In this code, anisotropic and isotropic goal-oriented mesh adaptation is applied to solving shallow
water and tracer transport problems using the coastal, estuarine and ocean modelling solver provided
by [Thetis][2]. Thetis is built upon the [Firedrake][1] project, which enables the efficient
solution of FEM problems in Python by automatic generation of [PETSc][3] code. Anisotropic mesh
adaptation is achieved using [PRAgMaTIc][4]. A continuous adjoint solver is provided for advection-diffusion problems and the discrete adjoint code [Pyadjoint][5] can be used to generate adjoint
solutions for more general problems. This is research of the Applied Modelling and Computation Group
([AMCG][6]) at Imperial College London.
