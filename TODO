# TODO: HDG formulation used by Thomas
#
#   * Use hybridization on the Lax-Friedrichs formulation to get a Lagrange multiplier on a
#     vector-valued trace space.
#   * Then statically condense down to the vector-trace system using an exact Schur complement.
#   * The direct AMG on the trace system should work just fine (for example, using GAMG)
#   * Once you have the HDG formulation written down, should be able to use firedrake.SCPC on it
#     just like in the HDG poisson example firedrake/tests/slate/test_hdg_poisson.py
#   * Try to not use LU on the trace system and go for a preconditioned Krylov method instead
#   * You will get more mileage out of LU for HDG since the condensed system is much smaller
#   * It will depend on how "fine" you want to  make the problem
#
#   * Ask Thomas if need help formulating the HDG problem
