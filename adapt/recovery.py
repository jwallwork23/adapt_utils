# --- Use the following drivers if only doing a single L2 projection on the current mesh

def construct_gradient(f, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Assuming the function `f` is P1 (piecewise linear and continuous), direct differentiation will
    give a gradient which is P0 (piecewise constant and discontinuous). Since we would prefer a
    smooth gradient, we solve an auxiliary finite element problem in P1 space. This "L2 projection"
    gradient recovery technique makes use of the Cl\'ement interpolation operator. That `f` is P1
    is not actually a requirement.

    :arg f: (scalar) P1 solution field.
    :kwarg bcs: boundary conditions for L2 projection.
    :param op: `Options` class object providing min/max cell size values.
    :return: reconstructed gradient associated with `f`.
    """
    return L2ProjectorGradient(f.function_space(), **kwargs).project(f)


def construct_hessian(f, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Assuming the smooth solution field has been approximated by a function `f` which is P1, all
    second derivative information has been lost. As such, the Hessian of `f` cannot be directly
    computed. We provide two means of recovering it, as follows. That `f` is P1 is not actually
    a requirement.

    (1) "Integration by parts" ('parts'):
    This involves solving the PDE $H = \nabla^T\nabla f$ in the weak sense. Code is based on the
    Monge-Amp\`ere tutorial provided on the Firedrake website:
    https://firedrakeproject.org/demos/ma-demo.py.html.

    (2) "Double L2 projection" ('dL2'):
    This involves two applications of the L2 projection operator. In this mode, we are permitted
    to recover the Hessian of a P0 field, since no derivatives of `f` are required.

    :arg f: P1 solution field.
    :param op: `Options` class object providing min/max cell size values.
    :return: reconstructed Hessian associated with `f`.
    """
    return DoubleL2ProjectorHessian(f.function_space(), boundary=False, **kwargs).project(f)


def construct_boundary_hessian(f, **kwargs):
    """
    Recover the Hessian of `f` on the domain boundary. That is, the Hessian in the direction
    tangential to the boundary. In two dimensions this gives a scalar field, whereas in three
    dimensions it gives a 2D field on the surface. The resulting field should only be considered on
    the boundary and is set arbitrarily to 1/h_max in the interior.

    :arg f: Scalar solution field.
    :param op: `Options` class object providing max cell size value.
