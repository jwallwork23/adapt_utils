This directory includes post-processed gauge timeseries `resources/gauges/*.dat`:
  * 8XY provided by [PARI][PARI] (the Port and Airport Research Institute of Japan). 
  * P0X provided by the authors of [1].
  * XPGY provided by [JAMSTEC][JAMSTEC] (the Japanese Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology).
  * 214XY provided by [NOAA][NOAA].
Bash scripts for manually downloading and processing the gauge data can be found in `resources/gauges/`.


It also includes coastal boundary data extracted from the [ETOPO1][ETOPO1] data set in `resources/boundaries/`.
The bathymetry data should be downloaded again and saved as `resources/bathymetry/etopo1.nc`.
