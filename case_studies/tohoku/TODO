General
=======
  * Add the source to the bathymetry
  * Don't cap the bathymetry
  * Weight gauges on distance(?)
  * Use wetting and drying(?)

Runs with real data
===================
  * Apply a de-tiding algorithm
  * Make sure the start times of the timeseries data are consistent
  * Reduce the QoI time extent to only include the period where we have data

Arrays
======
Consider a 19 x 10 array of rectangular subfaults and invert for the initial surface under the
assumption that the source is:
  (a) piecewise constant;
  (b) a rectangular Gaussian;
  (c) represented by the Okada model
on each subfault.

Unit sources(?)
===============
  * The subfault database is available at http://sift.pmel.noaa.gov/ComMIT/compressed/info_sz.dat
  * GeoClaw's `SiftFault` subclass can be used to load these.

Mesh adaptation
===============
  * Run DWP
  * Run DWR
