# TODO: (synthetic case)
#  * Interpolate "optimum" from Okada case using
#    - https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/RadialBasisFunctions.html;
#    - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.Rbf.html.
#  * May need to transform to a non-rotated space where the basis functions are square rather than rectangular
