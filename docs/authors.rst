``adapt_utils`` started out as the codebase for Joe Wallwork's PhD thesis on goal-oriented
mesh adaptation for coastal ocean modelling. Mariana Clare, a fellow PhD student at the
Mathematics of Planet Earth Centre for Doctoral Training (MPE CDT) based at Imperial College
London, helped to extend the code to consider mesh movement methods and hydro-morphodynamic
models.
