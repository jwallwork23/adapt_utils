## 15 turbine array

Test case as described in [Divett et al.].

Many thanks to [Nicolas Barral][1] for coding the original fixed mesh version of this test case in
Firedrake.

### Parameters:
  * TODO

### Boundary conditions:
  * TODO

### Quantity of interest
Power output (integral over turbine footprints and time period of cubed fluid speed, scaled by
turbine drag coefficient and divided by water depth).
