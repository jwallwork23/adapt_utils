## Spaceship tidal turbine test case:

Original problem, as described in [Walkington & Burrows], models a tidal stream farm in a narrow
region between basins. The idealised domain is inspired by the Strangford Lough geometry, with a
tidal free surface forcing on the open boundary.

The later work of [Kramer et al.] compared Fluidity and MIKE21 using the same domain but a modified
bathymetry. It is this latter bathymetry which is used here.
